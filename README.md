# u-develop-it

## Description

The goal of the project was to create a election database that incorporated data from candidates, voters, parties, and votes through using JavaScript and MySQL. I learned to create routes to specific data using Express.js, JavaScript, and SQL statements to direct the MySQL Shell in compiling, selecting, and deleting data.

## Installation

The project can be installed on your local computer through cloning the [Public GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlexandertheGreat491/u-develop-it.git), running npm start in the command line, and logging into MySQL through the MySQL Shell.

## Usage

If a person uses the installation instructions correctly, a database and table similar to the screenshot below will be created.
